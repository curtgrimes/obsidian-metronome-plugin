# Obsidian Metronome ðŸŽµ

Use this plugin to add interactive metronomes to your notes. Use just the visual metronome or turn on a click or beep. Customize the tempo, meter, instrument, size, and more. Pair it with [obsidian-plugin-abcjs](https://github.com/TilBlechschmidt/obsidian-plugin-abcjs) to have your score and metronome living in harmony in a single note!

This markdown in your Obsidian note:

````markdown
# My Metronome

```metronome
bpm: 120
meter: 3/4
size: medium
```
````

Produces this interactive metronome:

## Why?

I use [obsidian-plugin-abcjs](https://github.com/TilBlechschmidt/obsidian-plugin-abcjs) for writing out music notation in Obsidian and sometimes during live performances I have a need to know what tempo to play a song. This plugin provides a visual metronome that I can have right alongside my music that serves as a great reminder of the correct tempo for a live performance. During practice, I can unmute it and practice alongside it as it clicks on the beat.

## Install

1. In Obsidian, go to Settings > Community Plugins and disable safe mode if it is enabled.
1. Select **Browse** and search for the **Metronome** plugin.
1. Install the plugin.
1. Enable the plugin.

## Usage

Open a note and place a code block in your note like the one below. Give it a `bpm` ([beats per minute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo)) for your tempo. In the example below, I've set `bpm` to `120`.

````markdown
# My basic metronome

```metronome
bpm: 120
```
````

This produces a visual metronome in your note. By default it is muted, but you can press the unmute button to hear it click (or change the `muted` option so it clicks by default &mdash; see below for more options).

You can customize the metronome further:

````markdown
# My more fancy metronome

```metronome
bpm: 120
meter: 12/8
size: large
instrument: beep
tickNotes: A5
tockNotes: A4
```
````

## Metronome Options

These are all the options you can change when creating a metronome. Only the `bpm` option is required.

## Examples

### Setting `autoStart: no` on a metronome

If a metronome has `autoStart: no`, it won't start flashing when you open the note. You can also edit metronomes inline using Obsidian's live preview feature.

### Include alongside music notation

The metronome works great when placed alongside music notation using the [obsidian-plugin-abcjs](https://github.com/TilBlechschmidt/obsidian-plugin-abcjs) plugin.

![](images/demo-5.gif)

### Play multiple tones at once

Set `tickNotes` and `tockNotes` to a comma-separated list of tones to play those tones all at once in a chord.

````markdown
```metronome
bpm: 80

### Works with themes

The metronome works great with Obsidian's themes in light or dark mode.
